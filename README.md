# Background
This was a practice coding problem for an interview as a software developer to gain knowledge in API calls and efficient computations

# How to execute
Install the requirements from requirements.txt and then execute the Main.py. There isn't much of a graphical experience but many API calls are made.
If these API calls are not working, check the log file in the Source directory to see the problem.
In the event that the API is no longer active or maintained, there are sample text files of what the APIs were outputting.
Just point the API calls at the files instead of the browser address and it will still work
